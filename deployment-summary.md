# Fairway Car Detailing - Temporary Deployment Summary

## What We've Done

1. ✅ Built the production version of the website
2. ✅ Created a `.htaccess` file for proper SPA routing
3. ✅ Added a client-facing README file with feedback instructions
4. ✅ Generated deployment packages (zip files)
5. ✅ Created detailed instructions for Hostinger setup

## Files You'll Need

- **Deployment Package**: `/workspaces/fairway-car-detailing/deploy/fairway-car-detailing-20250513-185415.zip`
- **Setup Instructions**: `/workspaces/fairway-car-detailing/deployment-instructions.md`

## Next Steps

1. Download the deployment package from your workspace
2. Follow the instructions in `deployment-instructions.md` to set up the temporary subdomain on Hostinger
3. Share the temporary URL with your client along with feedback instructions
4. Collect feedback and implement any necessary changes
5. Once approved, proceed with deployment to the main domain

## Important Notes

- The `.htaccess` file is critical for proper routing - make sure it's uploaded correctly
- If your client experiences any routing issues (404 errors when refreshing), verify the `.htaccess` configuration
- Images have been optimized but the site still includes large assets - consider further optimization if load times are a concern
- The site is a single-page application (SPA), so proper server configuration is important

## Hostinger-Specific Tips

- Enable GZIP compression in Hostinger's hPanel for better performance
- Set up proper cache headers if they're not already included in the `.htaccess` file
- Make sure the SSL certificate is properly configured for the subdomain
- Test the site thoroughly after deployment to ensure all features work correctly
